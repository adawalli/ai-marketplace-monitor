# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Backward Compatibility Test Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive test suite to validate that all existing TOML configurations, cached data, and error handling patterns remain fully compatible after migration.
# Details:
Implement tests that load existing TOML config files and cached AIResponse objects, run evaluations through LangChainBackend, and compare outputs to prior results. Include tests for DeepSeek environment variable migration. Validate error handling consistency. Automate tests to run in CI.

# Test Strategy:
Use real marketplace data and configurations to verify zero breaking changes. Compare outputs byte-for-byte where applicable. Monitor logs for unexpected errors.
