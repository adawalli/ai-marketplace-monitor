# Task ID: 1
# Title: Install and Configure LangChain Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Install required LangChain packages with specified version constraints and configure environment for Python 3.10+ compatibility.
# Details:
Use uv add to install langchain-core>=0.3.5,<0.4.0, langchain-openai>=0.3.5,<0.4.0, langchain-community>=0.0.10,<0.1.0, langchain-deepseek (latest compatible), and optionally langsmith for tracing. Verify Python 3.10+ environment. Pin versions to avoid breaking changes. Validate installation by importing packages and running basic version checks. All dependency management should be handled via uv, not pip.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to import each package and instantiate minimal objects (e.g., ChatOpenAI) to confirm correct installation and compatibility. Ensure that the uv-managed environment reflects the correct versions and all dependencies are resolved.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Verify Environment Compatibility [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Check that the Python environment is version 3.10 or higher and that the uv dependency manager is available for package installation.
### Details:
Run `python --version` to confirm Python 3.10+ is installed. Ensure uv is installed and configured as the package manager instead of pip. This step prevents compatibility issues during package installation.

## 2. Install LangChain Packages with Version Pinning [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Use uv to install langchain-core, langchain-openai, langchain-community, langchain-deepseek, and optionally langsmith with specified version constraints to avoid breaking changes.
### Details:
Install langchain-core>=0.3.5,<0.4.0, langchain-openai>=0.3.5,<0.4.0, langchain-community>=0.0.10,<0.1.0, langchain-deepseek (latest compatible), and optionally langsmith for tracing integration. Pin versions explicitly to maintain stability.
<info added on 2025-08-06T00:37:49.730Z>
Research and identify the latest compatible versions of langchain-core, langchain-openai, and langchain-community that do not have dependency conflicts. Update the version constraints accordingly to ensure successful installation and compatibility. Document the resolved versions and any changes to the original constraints in this subtask.

## 3. Set Up Optional LangSmith Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Configure LangSmith tracing integration if required, including environment variables and any additional setup steps.
### Details:
If tracing is needed, install langsmith package and configure environment variables or API keys as necessary. This step is optional and should be skipped if tracing is not required.
<info added on 2025-08-06T00:38:10.184Z>
LangSmith (v0.4.11) is already installed as a dependency from the LangChain package installation. To enable tracing integration, set the environment variables LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true and provide LANGCHAIN_API_KEY as needed. No further setup is required unless tracing is explicitly needed.

## 4. Validate Installation via Import and Basic Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Confirm successful installation by importing installed packages and running basic version checks and minimal object instantiations.
### Details:
Write and run unit tests that import each installed package, check their versions, and instantiate minimal objects such as ChatOpenAI to verify compatibility and correct installation. Ensure uv-managed environment reflects correct versions.
<info added on 2025-08-06T00:38:33.262Z>
Installation validation successful. All required packages import correctly: langchain-core (0.3.72), langchain-openai, langchain-community, langchain-deepseek, and langsmith. Basic instantiation of ChatOpenAI confirms compatibility and correct setup. No issues detected; installation validation is complete.
