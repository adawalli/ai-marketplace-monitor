# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Response Adapter Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop adapter to convert LangChain response objects into existing AIResponse format to maintain cache compatibility and API consistency.
# Details:
Implement adapter functions or classes that take LangChain chat model responses and produce AIResponse objects identical in structure and serialization to existing ones. Handle token usage, message content, and metadata. Ensure serialization/deserialization compatibility with existing cache system.

# Test Strategy:
Test adapter with mocked LangChain responses and verify output matches expected AIResponse objects. Test cache serialization round-trip with adapted responses.
