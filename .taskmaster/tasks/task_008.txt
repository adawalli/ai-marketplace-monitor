# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement LangChain Exception Mapping
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Map LangChain exceptions to existing error patterns to preserve current error handling behavior across all providers.
# Details:
Create exception mapping layer that catches LangChain exceptions and raises corresponding existing SDK exceptions or error types. Maintain error messages and codes consistent with prior implementation. Integrate this mapping into LangChainBackend methods.

# Test Strategy:
Write tests that simulate LangChain exceptions and verify correct mapped exceptions are raised with expected messages.
