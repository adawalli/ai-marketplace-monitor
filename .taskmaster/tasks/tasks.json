If the provider is not found, a ValueError is raised with a clear unsupported backend message.\n- Compatibility requirements identified:\n  1. All three existing providers (\"deepseek\", \"openai\", \"ollama\") must be mapped to their corresponding LangChain model constructors, preserving current behavior.\n  2. Case-insensitive provider matching must be maintained throughout the compatibility layer.\n  3. OpenRouter must be supported as a new provider type, with appropriate mapping and validation.\n  4. Existing validation logic and error message patterns must be preserved for backward compatibility.\n  5. Thread safety for shared _chat_model instances must be ensured, matching or improving on the current backend implementations.\n\nThese findings will inform the design of the compatibility layer to guarantee seamless migration from the current TOML-based configuration to the new LangChain-backed system, with no disruption to existing user workflows or error handling.\n</info added on 2025-08-06T19:07:44.154Z>",

Verified that all tests pass and no deprecation warnings remain.\n- Simplified input sanitization logic by removing overly aggressive regex patterns that previously filtered legitimate marketplace content, while retaining essential security measures such as HTML escaping, exact LLM token filtering, and newline limiting to prevent abuse without false positives.\n\nAll 136 tests pass (with 1 skipped), backward compatibility is fully maintained, and the configuration compatibility layer is now cleaner, more maintainable, and free of technical debt.
