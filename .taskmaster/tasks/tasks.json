PushNotificationConfig.handle_message_format overrides TelegramNotificationConfig.handle_message_format due to inheritance order. PushNotificationConfig enforces default='plain_text' with allowed values ['plain_text', 'markdown', 'html'], while TelegramNotificationConfig requires default='markdownv2' with allowed values ['plain_text', 'markdown', 'markdownv2', 'html']. This creates incompatible field definitions when both classes are inherited. Solution options: 1) Reorder inheritance to prioritize TelegramNotificationConfig, 2) Create separate field definitions in UserConfig to override conflicts, or 3) Refactor base classes to use composition instead of multiple inheritance for notification configs.\n</info added on 2025-07-07T02:05:24.749Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-07T02:08:33.249Z>\nCOMPLETED on 2025-07-07: Successfully implemented the minimal class structure and dependency setup. Added TelegramNotificationConfig import to user.py:17 and included it in UserConfig inheritance chain (user.py:23-28). Resolved multiple inheritance conflicts by reordering inheritance to prioritize TelegramNotificationConfig first, fixing MRO conflicts that caused message_format to default to 'plain_text' instead of 'markdownv2'. Added python-telegram-bot dependency via poetry add. All 33 tests now pass (14 instantiation + 10 integration + 9 TOML tests) with proper field validation, required_fields checking, and inheritance behavior.
