If the provider is not found, a ValueError is raised with a clear unsupported backend message.\n- Compatibility requirements identified:\n  1. All three existing providers (\"deepseek\", \"openai\", \"ollama\") must be mapped to their corresponding LangChain model constructors, preserving current behavior.\n  2.
