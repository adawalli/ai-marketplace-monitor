# Task ID: 2
# Title: Define Provider Interface Contract
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an abstract base class defining the interface for all AI providers to standardize model retrieval, config mapping, error handling, and response adaptation.
# Details:
The ProviderInterface abstract base class has been implemented in provider_interface.py. It defines the required interface for all AI providers, including the methods get_model(config), map_config(config), handle_errors(error), and adapt_response(langchain_response), as specified in the PRD. All methods use appropriate type hints, including langchain_core.language_models.BaseChatModel where relevant. This interface serves as the contract for provider-specific logic in LangChainBackend and ensures consistency across provider implementations.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive tests have been added to validate interface compliance. These tests use mock subclasses to ensure all abstract methods are implemented and that instantiating incomplete subclasses raises errors as expected. All tests pass successfully, confirming that the interface contract is enforced.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Abstract Base Class with Method Signatures and Type Hints [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the ProviderInterface abstract base class in provider_interface.py using Python's abc module. Define abstract methods get_model(config), map_config(config), handle_errors(error), and adapt_response(langchain_response) with appropriate type hints, including langchain_core.language_models.BaseChatModel where relevant.
### Details:
Use abc.ABC as the base class and decorate methods with @abstractmethod. Ensure method signatures enforce the interface contract and include detailed type annotations for parameters and return types to guarantee type safety.

Successfully implemented ProviderInterface as an abstract base class in src/ai_marketplace_monitor/provider_interface.py. The class defines four abstract methods: get_model(config) -> BaseChatModel, map_config(config) -> Dict[str, Any], handle_errors(error) -> Exception, and adapt_response(langchain_response) -> AIResponse. Each method includes precise type hints and comprehensive docstrings detailing parameters, return values, and possible exceptions. This interface enforces a standardized contract for provider-specific logic required during LangChain migration.

## 2. Implement Mock Subclasses for Interface Compliance Testing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create mock subclasses of ProviderInterface to test that all abstract methods are implemented correctly. Include a mock subclass that omits one or more abstract methods to verify that instantiating it raises the expected TypeError.
### Details:
Use unittest or pytest frameworks to write tests that instantiate mock subclasses. Confirm that subclasses implementing all methods instantiate successfully, while incomplete subclasses raise errors. This ensures the abstract base class enforces the interface contract at runtime.
<info added on 2025-08-06T00:52:21.833Z>
Implemented mock subclasses CompleteProviderMock, IncompleteProviderMock, and PartialProviderMock in tests/test_provider_interface.py. CompleteProviderMock implements all four abstract methods and instantiates successfully. IncompleteProviderMock (missing three methods) and PartialProviderMock (missing two methods) both raise TypeError upon instantiation as expected. Tests confirm that all abstract methods can be called on the complete implementation, verifying that the ProviderInterface contract is strictly enforced at runtime. All compliance tests pass.

## 3. Write Comprehensive Compliance Tests for ProviderInterface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop unit tests that validate the ProviderInterface contract enforcement using the mock subclasses. Test method signatures, type hints, and error handling behavior to ensure full compliance with the interface requirements.
### Details:
Tests should cover instantiation, method calls with valid and invalid inputs, and confirm that type hints align with expected types. Use mocks or stubs for langchain_core.language_models.BaseChatModel where needed. Verify that incomplete implementations are rejected and that the interface contract is strictly enforced.
