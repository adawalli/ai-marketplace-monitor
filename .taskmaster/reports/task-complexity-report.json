      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the installation process into steps: verifying environment and poetry setup, adding the dependency, and validating no conflicts with existing dependencies.",
      "reasoning": "Installing a dependency with poetry is straightforward but requires careful validation of compatibility and conflict checking with existing dependencies to avoid runtime issues."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for modifying UserConfig inheritance, updating TOML parsing logic, and adding validation for telegram-specific fields.",
      "reasoning": "Integration requires careful modification of configuration inheritance and parsing logic, plus validation, which adds complexity beyond simple class creation."

      "expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for creating the synchronous wrapper around async calls, instantiating telegram.Bot, and handling message sending with error checks.",
      "reasoning": "Wrapping async library calls synchronously and ensuring correct message sending involves moderate complexity and careful handling of async-to-sync bridging."
