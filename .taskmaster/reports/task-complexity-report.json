			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Install and Configure LangChain Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the installation into environment verification, package installation with version pinning, optional LangSmith integration setup, and validation via import and basic tests.",
			"reasoning": "Installing and configuring dependencies is straightforward but requires careful version pinning and environment checks to avoid compatibility issues. Optional tracing integration adds slight complexity. Validation ensures correctness before proceeding."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define Provider Interface Contract",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks for defining the abstract base class, implementing method signatures with type hints, and writing compliance tests with mock subclasses.",
			"reasoning": "Defining a robust interface requires careful design to cover all provider interactions and error handling, plus ensuring type safety and test coverage to enforce contract adherence."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Provider Mapping System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for creating the provider_map dictionary, implementing each provider mapping logic (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Ollama, OpenRouter), handling environment variables, and unit testing each mapping.",
			"reasoning": "Mapping multiple providers with distinct configuration and environment requirements involves moderate complexity, especially ensuring correct parameterization and integration with existing config."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop LangChainBackend Base Class",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks to include class skeleton creation, implementing _get_model using provider_map, connection and retry logic, error handling integration, backward compatibility preservation, and comprehensive unit testing.",
			"reasoning": "This core backend class must unify multiple concerns including provider integration, error handling, and backward compatibility, requiring careful design and thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Compatibility Layer",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks for extending the config parser, mapping old provider strings to new keys, handling DeepSeek API key migration, and running backward compatibility tests.",
			"reasoning": "Maintaining seamless compatibility with existing TOML configs while migrating to LangChain models requires careful mapping and validation to avoid breaking existing user setups."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate OpenRouter Provider",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for implementing OpenRouter mapping in provider_map, updating config parser to accept new provider and models, validating API keys, and unit testing provider instantiation and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Adding a new provider with custom base_url and headers is moderately complex but benefits from reuse of existing ChatOpenAI integration patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Response Adapter Layer",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for designing adapter functions/classes, handling token usage and metadata translation, ensuring serialization compatibility, and testing with mocked responses and cache round-trips.",
			"reasoning": "Adapting response formats to maintain cache and API consistency requires detailed mapping of response fields and careful serialization handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement LangChain Exception Mapping",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks for identifying LangChain exceptions, mapping them to existing SDK exceptions, integrating mapping into backend methods, and writing tests to verify correct exception translation.",
			"reasoning": "Exception mapping is critical for preserving error handling behavior but involves a limited set of mappings and integration points."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Caching with LangChainBackend",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks for modifying caching logic to accept adapted AIResponse objects, verifying serialization format consistency, and running integration tests for cache behavior.",
			"reasoning": "Ensuring caching works seamlessly with new backend and response formats is important but mostly involves adapting existing cache logic and thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Backward Compatibility Test Suite",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for loading existing TOML configs, loading cached AIResponse objects, running evaluations through LangChainBackend, comparing outputs to prior results, and automating tests in CI.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive backward compatibility testing is complex due to the need for byte-for-byte output comparison, real data usage, and integration across multiple components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Optional LangSmith Integration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks for environment variable detection, LangSmith client initialization, conditional tracing activation, and testing with tracing enabled and disabled.",
			"reasoning": "Optional integration with environment-controlled activation is relatively straightforward but requires careful handling to avoid impact when disabled."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Update Internal Documentation and Developer Guides",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks for updating README, revising developer guides, adding migration notes and troubleshooting tips, and conducting documentation review sessions.",
			"reasoning": "Documentation updates are essential for maintainability but involve mostly content revision and validation rather than complex implementation."
