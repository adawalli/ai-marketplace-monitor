# ===================================================================
# Event Loop Management Configuration
# ===================================================================
# This configuration solves the event loop conflict between pytest-asyncio
# and pytest-playwright when both are used in the same test suite.
#
# Problem:
# - pytest-playwright creates its own event loop for browser automation
# - pytest-asyncio tries to manage event loops for async test methods
# - When both run together, pytest-asyncio throws "RuntimeError: This event
#   loop is already running" because Playwright's loop is already active
#
# Solution:
# - Configure pytest-asyncio in 'auto' mode with function-scoped fixtures
# - Use test markers to allow selective test execution if needed
# - Split test execution in tasks.py to run different test types separately
# ===================================================================

# Configure pytest-asyncio to use auto mode
# This prevents conflicts with other async frameworks like Playwright
asyncio_mode = auto
asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = function

# Markers for different types of tests
# These allow selective execution if event loop conflicts arise
markers =
    asyncio: marks tests as async (deselect with '-m "not asyncio"')
    playwright: marks tests as using Playwright (deselect with '-m "not playwright"')
    telegram: marks tests as telegram-related (deselect with '-m "not telegram"')
    no_asyncio: marks tests to run without pytest-asyncio event loop management
