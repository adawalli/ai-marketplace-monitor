# Product Requirements Document: Telegram Integration Fix

## Introduction/Overview

The current Telegram integration in the AI marketplace monitor is experiencing frequent formatting errors, particularly with MarkdownV2 parsing, causing message send failures. This PRD outlines the requirements to simplify and fix the Telegram integration to achieve 99% message delivery success rate while maintaining formatted text output.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate MarkdownV2 parsing errors** that currently prevent message delivery
2. **Achieve 99% message delivery success rate** for Telegram notifications
3. **Maintain formatted text output** with proper bold, italic, and clickable links
4. **Follow Telegram's best practices** for message formatting and handling
5. **Implement robust error handling** with fallback mechanisms
6. **Improve testability** to catch formatting issues before production

## User Stories

1. **As a marketplace monitor user**, I want to receive properly formatted Telegram notifications about new listings so that I can quickly scan and evaluate opportunities without formatting errors blocking delivery.

2. **As a system administrator**, I want the Telegram integration to handle formatting errors gracefully so that users never miss notifications due to parsing failures.

3. **As a developer**, I want comprehensive error handling and logging so that I can quickly identify and resolve any integration issues.

4. **As a user**, I want long messages to be handled appropriately following Telegram's best practices so that I receive complete information without truncation or formatting issues.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Message Formatting**
   1.1. The system must successfully send formatted messages with bold, italic, and clickable links
   1.2. The system must properly escape special characters according to Telegram's MarkdownV2 specification
   1.3. The system must handle edge cases in marketplace listing descriptions (special characters, emojis, etc.)

2. **Error Handling**
   2.1. The system must detect MarkdownV2 parsing errors and automatically retry with plain text formatting
   2.2. The system must log all formatting errors with sufficient detail for debugging
   2.3. The system must implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
   2.4. The system must continue processing subsequent messages even if individual messages fail

3. **Message Length Handling**
   3.1. The system must split messages longer than Telegram's 4096 character limit
   3.2. The system must preserve formatting across message splits
   3.3. The system must add appropriate numbering (e.g., "1/3", "2/3") to split messages

4. **Library Integration**
   4.1. The system must use a well-supported Telegram library (e.g., python-telegram-bot)
   4.2. The system must follow the library's recommended practices for message formatting
   4.3. The system must handle library-specific error types appropriately

5. **Testing**
   5.1. The system must include unit tests that validate message formatting with various input types
   5.2. The system must include integration tests that verify successful message delivery
   5.3. The system must include test cases for edge cases (special characters, long messages, etc.)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Other notification channels** - This fix focuses solely on Telegram integration
2. **Message content changes** - The actual content and structure of marketplace notifications will remain unchanged
3. **Performance optimization** - Focus is on reliability, not speed improvements
4. **New Telegram features** - No new bot commands, keyboards, or interactive features
5. **Multi-language support** - Formatting fixes apply to current English content only

## Technical Considerations

1. **Library Selection**: Evaluate and potentially migrate to python-telegram-bot library if not already in use
2. **Escape Function**: Implement robust MarkdownV2 escaping that handles all special characters
3. **Fallback Strategy**: Clear hierarchy of formatting attempts (MarkdownV2 → Markdown → Plain text)
4. **Logging**: Structured logging with sufficient context for debugging production issues
5. **Configuration**: Externalize message formatting options for easy adjustment

## Success Metrics

1. **Message Delivery Rate**: 99% of Telegram messages sent successfully
2. **Formatting Success Rate**: 95% of messages delivered with proper formatting (not falling back to plain text)
3. **Error Reduction**: 90% reduction in Telegram-related errors in application logs
4. **Test Coverage**: 100% test coverage for message formatting functions
5. **Zero Production Surprises**: No formatting errors discovered in production that weren't caught by tests

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement message queuing for failed messages to retry later?
2. What's the acceptable delay for fallback formatting attempts?
3. Should we add monitoring/alerting for high fallback rates?
4. Do we need to preserve exact formatting from the original implementation, or can we simplify?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All existing Telegram message functionality works without formatting errors
- [ ] Messages with special characters (parentheses, periods, etc.) send successfully
- [ ] Long messages are properly split and formatted across multiple parts
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite catches formatting issues before production
- [ ] Error handling gracefully falls back to plain text when formatting fails
- [ ] Application logs provide clear information about any Telegram delivery issues
- [ ] Integration achieves 99% message delivery success rate in production testing
